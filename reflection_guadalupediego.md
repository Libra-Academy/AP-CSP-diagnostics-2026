1. The first things I saw was that I need to read carefully to understand what the tasks was asking me to do
   
2.  The confusing parts was understanding how to properly make a copy, without affecting other student's work
   
3.   I reread the instructions and checked some GitHub videos and guides when I was unsure
   
4.   I  forced on instructions that told what to do, like the files names and how to fixs bugs, I would say
  
5. I feel more confident with GitHub because now I understand how to create files, commiting to changes, and understanding forks

6. I still feel unsure on how to resloving some conflicts, like how know if I'm affecting other studnet's work
